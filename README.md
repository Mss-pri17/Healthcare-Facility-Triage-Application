# General Healthcare Facility Pre-Triage Application

# Learnings and Skill Development
Working on the "General Healthcare Facility Pre-Triage Application" project has been a valuable learning experience for me.
As I transitioned from C to C++, I gained a deeper understanding of object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts and how they
can be applied to real-world problems.

# Encapsulation and Data Abstraction
✒ One of the key learnings was the importance of encapsulation and data abstraction. By designing classes to represent the different 
entities in the healthcare facility, such as Patients, ContagionPatients, and TriagePatients, I was able to create a more modular 
and maintainable codebase. This allowed me to focus on the specific responsibilities of each class and ensure that the data and 
functionality were properly encapsulated.

# Inheritance and Polymorphism
✒ Additionally, I expanded my knowledge of inheritance and polymorphism. Implementing the ContagionPatient and TriagePatient classes
as derived from the base Patient class helped me understand how to leverage inheritance to create specialized behaviors while 
maintaining a common interface. This, in turn, improved the flexibility and extensibility of the application.
Challenges and Strategies

# Module Architecture
✒ One of the most significant challenges I faced was designing the overall architecture of the application and ensuring that the different
components (e.g., PreTriage module, Contagion Test Center, Triage Center) worked together seamlessly. Coordinating the flow of patients, 
managing the queue, and handling the ticket assignment required careful planning and implementation.

# Strategies 
✒ To overcome this challenge, I employed a combination of strategies. First, I spent time carefully planning the class hierarchy and 
the interactions between the different modules. I created detailed UML diagrams to visualize the relationships and dependencies, 
which helped me identify potential bottlenecks and areas for improvement.
✒ Additionally, I made extensive use of unit testing to validate the correctness of each individual component. By writing comprehensive
test cases, I was able to identify and address issues early in the development process, ensuring that the overall system functioned as expected.
✒ Throughout the project, I also relied on effective debugging techniques, such as strategic use of print statements and the debugger, 
to identify and resolve complex issues. This allowed me to gain a deeper understanding of the underlying logic and make informed decisions 
during the development process.
